MFS
===

Mfs or Mailfs is a linux kernel IMAP file system. It allows to mount an IMAP
server in a directory and reading mails by reading files.


NOTICE
------

This project is at its early stage, and has only a pedagogic purpose to help me
learn how fs and networking work inside linux kernel. If you still want to give
it a shot I strongly recommend to test it in a VM.


How to use it
-------------

As root user:
	insmod ./mfs.ko
	mount -o port=IMAPPORT,login=IMAPLOGIN,pass=IMAPPASS -tmfs IPADDR /mnt/mail

As normal user:
	ls /mnt/mail/INBOX
	cat /mnt/mail/INBOX/12


TODO (not in order)
-------------------

	- Export mail in an maildir/mbox/understandable format
	- Implement mail body cache, so not to fetch mail body too often
	- Support multidirectory imap, so far only INBOX mails are working
	- Pass user:login as mount options
	- Support mail deletion when doing a "rm" on it.
	- Support concurrent file access (protect imap structure)
	- and so on ...
